Please find the following observations

* Items should flow only within text frame selected. Now it is not like this. If it is only half page, it should flow within that limit. So, this size is to be considered before creating the delimited.
* Required provision to place Advertisement boxes. Items should not flow over advertisement boxes. Now, it overlaps
* If any picture or text file is missing while flowing, should show an alert with details. Now it is not showing any error.
* We should consider the scenario of two obit pages in some  days. This is required on days after holidays. Here the number of items will be more. A full page is flown first, then the remaining is to be flown to one more page.
* Provision to flow other units delimited files to the already flown page so as to fill the page. Here it should not flow the duplicate items. Now it is placed on top of existing items
* Each obit should have a unique ID . When we flow multiple delimited files into a page, duplicates can be avoided with unique ID only.
* This unique ID should also be shown in panel
* Indesign crashing if any error occurs.
* Should show the list of non flown items, if any.
* ~~Now page is creating as untitled. Naming should be like "KTM Obit-Kottayam-Manorama-Third-A-08112023-15.indd~~
* Open page -  Warning should be shown while opening, when there is a latest version of the same page
* Release page / Unrelease page button
* ~~Print - Create PDF button~~
* Save to next edition.
